# MapReduce-B-Tree-and-Geospatial-Indexing-in-MongoDB
Used JavaScript functions to populate collections. To increase query performance, used B-Tree (range) and geospatial indexing. Ran aggregated queries to return structures exclusive of individual documents. Used MongoDBâ€™s version of MapReduce to fetch distinct digit counts for phone numbers in an extensively large dataset.
